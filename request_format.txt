You can test making requests to the REST endpoints using an application such as Postman. 

An example RunMatch request would have the following format:

{
  "game_engine_name": "idk-game-engine",
  "num_players": 2,
  "user_submissions": [
    {
      "username": "team1",
      "remote_location": "test-arrived.txt",
      "remote_directory": "idk-bucket-name-maybe"
    }, 
    {
      "username": "team2",
      "remote_location": "test-arrived2.txt",
      "remote_directory": "also-an-idk-field"
    }
  ]
}
